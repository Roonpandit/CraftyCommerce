## Project Overview

**CraftyCommerce** is an online marketplace dedicated to connecting artisans with customers who value unique, handcrafted products. This platform provides a space for artisans to showcase and sell a wide range of handmade goods, including art, jewelry, home decor, and more. The CraftyCommerce project is designed to deliver a fully functional, scalable e-commerce platform that prioritizes user experience, security, and efficient performance.

The goal of this project is to simulate a real-world software development process, focusing on version control and collaborative development using Git and GitHub. The project is divided into multiple features, each managed in separate branches to ensure smooth and organized development.

## Branches and Features

### 1. `feature-product-listing`
**Purpose:**  
The `feature-product-listing` branch was dedicated to developing the product listing functionality, allowing artisans to showcase their products on the platform. This feature is essential for the core operation of the marketplace, providing users with the ability to browse and discover handmade goods.

**Features Developed:**
- **Product Listing Page:** Designed and implemented the layout and structure of the product listing page, ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
- **Data Integration:** Integrated product data from the backend, enabling dynamic display of product information, including images, descriptions, and pricing.
- **Filtering and Sorting:** Developed advanced filtering and sorting functionalities, allowing users to refine their search results based on categories, price range, and popularity.

**Challenges Faced:**
- **State Management:** Managing complex state for dynamic filtering and sorting required careful implementation using Reactâ€™s state and effect hooks, ensuring that the UI remained responsive and performant.

### 2. `feature-shopping-cart`
**Purpose:**  
The `feature-shopping-cart` branch focused on the development of the shopping cart functionality, which is crucial for enabling customers to select and purchase products from the marketplace. This feature enhances the user experience by providing a seamless and intuitive checkout process.

**Features Developed:**
- **Shopping Cart UI:** Designed and implemented the shopping cart user interface, allowing users to easily add, remove, and update items in their cart.
- **Backend Integration:** Integrated the shopping cart with backend APIs to manage cart items, ensuring data consistency and synchronization between the client and server.
- **Checkout Process:** Developed the checkout flow, including order summary, payment options, and order confirmation, providing a smooth and secure transaction experience.

## Git Commands Used

Throughout the development of FoodFiesta, the following Git commands were utilized to manage the version control and collaboration process:

- **`git clone`**: To clone the repository from GitHub to the local machine.
- **`git checkout -b`**: To create and switch to a new branch for feature development or bug fixes.
- **`git add`**: To stage changes in the working directory for the next commit.
- **`git commit -m`**: To commit staged changes with a descriptive message.
- **`git push origin`**: To push the current branch to the remote repository on GitHub.
- **`git pull origin main`**: To update the current branch with the latest changes from the main branch.
- **`git log`**: To view the commit history and track changes made to the project.
- **`git status`**: To check the current state of the workspace, including staged, unstaged, and untracked files.

**Challenges Faced:**
- **Asynchronous Operations:** Handling multiple asynchronous API calls during the checkout process introduced race conditions, which were effectively managed using Promises and async/await syntax to ensure data integrity.

### 3. `feature-customer-reviews`
**Purpose:**  
The `feature-customer-reviews` branch was created to implement the customer reviews feature, enabling users to leave feedback on products they have purchased. This feature is vital for building trust and credibility within the marketplace, as well as providing valuable insights to artisans.

**Features Developed:**
- **Review Form and Rating System:** Developed a user-friendly review form with a rating system, allowing customers to rate products and provide written feedback.
- **Review Display:** Implemented the functionality to display customer reviews on the product page, including average ratings and individual review details.
- **Backend Integration:** Integrated the review system with the backend, ensuring secure storage and retrieval of review data, with proper validation to prevent spam and abuse.

**Challenges Faced:**
- **Security Measures:** Implementing security measures, such as CAPTCHA and validation, to prevent spam reviews and ensure that only verified customers could leave feedback, required careful consideration and testing.

## Lessons Learned

### Branch Management
- **Structured Development:** The use of feature-specific branches allowed for organized and focused development, reducing the likelihood of conflicts and making it easier to track progress on individual features.
- **Regular Merging:** Merging changes regularly from the master branch into feature branches helped keep the development in sync, minimizing the risk of major conflicts and ensuring that all team members were working with the latest code.

### Collaboration and Communication
- **Effective Communication:** Regular communication among team members was critical to the success of the project. It ensured that everyone was aligned on goals and deadlines, and that potential issues were addressed promptly.
- **Code Reviews:** Implementing a code review process via pull requests facilitated collaboration, allowing team members to provide feedback, catch bugs early, and ensure code quality before merging into the master branch.

### Version Control Best Practices
- **Descriptive Commits:** Writing clear, descriptive commit messages was essential for maintaining an understandable and navigable project history. It allowed the team to quickly identify and understand changes made at each stage of development.
- **Incremental Commits:** Committing changes incrementally rather than in large batches helped in isolating issues and made the development process more manageable and trackable.

### Resolving Conflicts
- **Merge Conflicts:** Encountering and resolving merge conflicts provided valuable experience in understanding how Git handles changes and how to effectively manage and resolve conflicts to maintain a clean and functional codebase.
- **Rebasing:** The use of Git rebase in certain scenarios allowed for a cleaner project history by integrating changes from one branch into another without creating unnecessary merge commits.
